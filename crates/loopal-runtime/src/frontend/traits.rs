/// (Envelope mailbox) and Control Plane (ControlCommand channel) into
/// the `AgentInput`-based interface consumed by the agent loop.
///
/// ## Emission semantics
///
/// `emit()` behaviour depends on the agent role:
/// - **Root agent**: propagates errors (TUI disconnect is fatal).
/// - **Sub-agent**: best-effort — silently drops events if the parent
///   channel is closed, so that a dying parent does not crash children.
///
/// Callers should NOT rely on `emit()` failures for control flow.
